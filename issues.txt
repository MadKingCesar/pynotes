Some issues I found while using python:
Pip3 for some reason is not supported for later versions of python from known repos so grab directly from source if u want latest version
Oh-my-zsh framework uses python3.8 as max and Tcl/TK including other build dependencies are not included and they are a HASSLE to install
The easiest solution I found is using dev build of python (3.11 as of 27-10-22) which has Tkinter, TCL and other dependencies already installed.
Preferred editor is VSCODE or Sublime, but prefer the first (plugin support, quick debugging) (UNLESS YOU GET PYTHON SETUP WITH EX) NEOVIM)
